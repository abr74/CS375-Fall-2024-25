Q2. 
a. most APIs require an API key for authentication, rate limiting, usage tracking, and access control
b. If you make a requestion with an invalid API key, it will return an error with 401 Unauthorized
c. We store it in separate file instead of hardcoing them in the server code for security, configuaration management and enviroment isolation
d. Some of the advantage are security, cors issues , data processing and consistency.

Q3.
1.
    Trigger: When the server gets a request at /data endpoint
    Order: It will print first after the client clicks the submit button
    Location: Server terminal
2.
    Trigger: When the API responds successfully
    Order: It will print after the API responses
    Location: Server terminal
3.
    Trigger: If there is an error with API request
    Order: It will print after the API response fail
    Location: Server terminal
4.
    Trigger: After the request is sent to the API
    Order:  It will print when the API is request is sent
    Location: Server terminal
5.
    Trigger: When server starts and listens to requests
    Order: It is printed when the server starts
    Location: Server terminal
6.
    Trigger: When browser receives a response from the server
    Order: It will print after the client-side fetch request completes
    Location: Browser console
7.
    Trigger: When the response body is converted to JSON
    Order: It will print after the response headers been logged and body is parsed
    Location: Browser console
8.
    Trigger: After the JSON response is logged on console
    Order: It will print after the previous log
    Location: Browser console
9.
    Trigger: If there is an error during fetch request
    Order: It will print if there is an error with the fetch request
    Location: Browser console
10.
    Trigger: After the fetch request is initiated on the client side
    Order: It will print after the button click event is triggered
    Location: Browser console

The client passes the zip code to the server through the URL in the fetch request

It uses Axios to send a request to the URL with zip code and API key

We use res.json() to send the API's response to the client because it sets the correct headers

We will get an empty object to the client because axios request did not wait for response
